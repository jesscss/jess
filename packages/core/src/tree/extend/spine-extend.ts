/**
 * spine-extend.ts — the EXTEND-WORK GATE for the single downward pass (P3, increment 0).
 * =====================================================================================
 *
 * This module owns the §4.0 EXTEND-WORK GATE: the decision, made ONCE at spine entry,
 * of whether the pass must engage the extend layer (PLAN / SOLVE / buffer-then-flush)
 * at all. It is the FAST-PATH guard the whole extend fold hangs off:
 *
 *   - NO `:extend` anywhere in the tree  → `engageExtendLayer` returns false and the
 *     pass stays a PURE STREAMING SPINE (design §2): every ruleset header is final the
 *     moment the walk reaches it, so headers emit inline with ZERO deferral, ZERO
 *     per-subject buffering, ZERO PLAN/SOLVE. This is the COMMON case and it must cost
 *     nothing — the buffer/flush machinery of §4.4 (added in later increments) exists
 *     solely to serve extend deferral, and deferral only arises from a reaching extend.
 *
 *   - `:extend` present → the extend layer engages for the reaching subjects only
 *     (later increments; increment 0 wires ONLY the gate + its zero-cost lock).
 *
 * INCREMENT 0 SCOPE (this file today). The spine has no PLAN/SOLVE/buffering yet, and
 * `isSpineEligibleRoot`/`hasExtendedTopLevelSelector` already keep every extend-bearing
 * root OFF the spine (`emit-walk.ts` extend gate). So the invariant this module LOCKS is
 * the safety floor for the riskiest phase: *a render whose tree carries no `:extend`
 * performs zero extend-layer work.* The counters below are the instrument the ratchet
 * reads to prove it (all zero for an extend-free render). As later increments add PLAN,
 * SOLVE, and per-subject buffering, each bumps its counter through THIS module, so the
 * zero-extend ratchet keeps guarding that the fast path never silently starts paying.
 *
 * KEYING — STATIC TREE PRESENCE, not `context.extends`. The design §4.0 phrases the gate
 * as `context.extends empty`, but `context.extends` is populated by the EVAL gather
 * (`extend.ts:341`), which the spine SKIPS. The spine's honest, eval-free signal is the
 * STATIC presence of an `:extend` selector on the source tree (`F_EXTENDED`), read by
 * `treeHasExtend`. This is the same predicate `isSpineEligibleRoot` already trusts to
 * route extend-bearing roots to the eval path — reused here as the gate key so the two
 * decisions cannot diverge.
 *
 * NOT the render cutover's whole extend fold — increment 0 is the gate + lock only. Not
 * exported from `index.ts` beyond what the ratchet needs → minimal bundle surface.
 *
 * @see UNIFIED-EVAL-EMIT-DESIGN.md §4.0 (extend-work gate), §4.4 (flush discipline)
 * @see CUTOVER-CHECKLIST.md P3 — "Extend-work gate (§4.0) — the fast path"
