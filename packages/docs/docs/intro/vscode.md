A VSCode language extension [is planned](https://github.com/jesscss/jess/issues/25). (If you know how to develop VSCode extensions, we could use your help!) In the meantime, to get basic code coloring, you can do the following:

### Install PostCSS Language Support

Jess doesn't use PostCSS, but this is a syntax highlighter that is flexible to syntax.

The extension can be found here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss

### Associate `.jess` files with PostCSS

Add this to your `settings.json` file:
```json
    "files.associations": {
        "*.jess": "postcss"
    }
```

### Other IDEs

For other IDEs, the process should be similar. Find a flexible CSS-y syntax highlighter (like PostCSS), and associate it with `.jess` files.
