You've heard of CSS-in-JS. But Jess uses a newfangled amazing new technique called CSS-in-CSS.

Steps to making a `.jess` file:

### 1. Write some CSS.

And save it as `.jess`
 
```scss
// myfile.jess
.my-header {
  background: rebeccapurple;
  padding: 2em 4em;
}
```

### 2. Build it
```
jess myfile.jess
```

### 3. You're already done, there are no more steps

(Okay, there are maybe a few more things to learn about Jess.)
