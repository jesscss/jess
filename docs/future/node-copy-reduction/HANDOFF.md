# Node Copy Reduction — Handoff

## Read This First

1. [eval-state-sketch.md](./eval-state-sketch.md)
2. [node-update-status.md](./node-update-status.md)
3. [README.md](./README.md)

## Current Direction

The branch should move toward:

- canonical nodes with canonical edges
- alternate parent/child edges keyed by `RenderKey`
- field-aligned child edge storage (`fooEdge` / `fooEdges`)
- cursor-based traversal: `{ node, renderKey }`
- shallow `Rules` wrappers as the owners of local declaration/mixin/ruleset registries

The branch should move away from:

- `EvalState` / `NodeState` as the target model
- field patches
- render-root-owned patch tables
- clone/materialize escape hatches for ordinary eval flow

Core tests no longer need to preserve old-model mutation APIs. Do not add new
`activeState` / `setField` / `getField` test setup back into
`packages/core/src/tree/__tests__` or `packages/core/src/tree/util/__tests__`.

## Working Rules

- preserve Jess behavior
- prefer smaller targeted changes over broad rewrites
- do not introduce new detached overlay concepts
- if a node cannot answer a parent question without a render key, use a cursor
- if a lookup only needs path selection, pass `renderKey` or cursor, not full
  `Context`
- for typed field reads, prefer `get<Field>(renderKey?)`
- on converted nodes, inline `fooEdge?.get(renderKey) ?? foo` instead of
  routing typed field reads back through generic `.get(...)`
- reserve `enter<Field>(...)` for helpers that may wrap/adopt to establish a
  render-owned container
- if a node-local value truly changes identity, use a thin derived node only if edge rewiring is not enough
- do not add new generic `childEdges` maps as target architecture
- when iterating, prefer one narrow component proof over broad suite churn

## Work Loop

1. Pick one narrow production target from [node-update-status.md](./node-update-status.md).
2. Change the smallest owner/path surface that moves that target toward cursor + edge traversal.
3. Add or update one focused proof test for that exact surface.
4. Run only the focused proof and the nearest behavioral file while iterating.
5. Update docs only if the model or migration status actually changed.
6. Commit and push.

## What To Delete Over Time

- `_carriedState`
- `subtreeMap`
- old detached wrapper/materialize helpers
- any new code that assumes `EvalState` is the final architecture
