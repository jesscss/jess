# Node Copy Reduction — Handoff

## Open This First

This is the live status and next-work page for the eval/render/copy refactor.
Keep it current enough that an agent can open this file, see where the repo is,
and pick the next honest checkpoint without rebuilding weeks of context.

Use [README.md](./README.md) for the architecture rules. Use this file for the
current state, immediate queue, and verification commands.

## Status Snapshot

- Public CSS output APIs use awaited eval/render; `safeCompile(...)` remains
  the explicit tree-surface compatibility/debug API.
- Public `preEval()` and the old `preEvaluated` flag are gone. Registration
  setup is explicit through `prepareRegistration()` and `registrationPrepared`.
- The compiler render phase writes through `Rules.render(...)` into a flat
  buffer. `renderNodeToBuffer(...)`, `renderNodeToWriter(...)`, and
  `renderNodeToString(...)` are internal/test bridges only.
- Base `Node.render(context)` is direct source serialization. Nodes with
  context-dependent output choose local evaluated output and serialize through
  shared print state.
- `renderEvalOutput(...)`, `writeRootAwareEvalOutput(...)`, and
  `renderChosenOutput(...)` are gone. Current local eval/resolve render paths
  use native streaming or `renderSourceOutput(...)`.
- Invisible side-effect nodes share `renderInvisibleEffect(...)`; the old
  no-output helper split is gone.
- `$if`, `$for`, and `$while` avoid materializing control-wrapper output before
  buffer render. `$for` and `$while` stream per iteration through direct
  `Rules.render(...)` calls.
- Control direct-string render uses one local flat-buffer adapter so direct
  output keeps the same per-iteration newline behavior as buffer output.
- `Rules.render(context)` keeps the root CSS-document newline but trims one
  trailing rule separator for non-root direct string fragments; buffer render
  preserves the full emitted fragment text for aggregation.
- `$if` selected-branch render now calls branch `Rules.render(context)` for the
  trimmed branch block and writes that text into the caller buffer; it no
  longer explicitly evals the branch and serializes the completed output.
- Loop state is frame-backed: `$while` mutation uses a live `ScopeFrame`, and
  `$for` / `$while` reuse canonical direct body children without reparenting.
- Loop eval output grouping wrappers do not copy function registries. Runtime
  iteration/state surfaces still preserve function registries because they
  participate in lookup while rendering/evaluating the body.
- `$for` loop-body registration prep is lazy and only runs once an iteration
  exists. Empty `$for` output and false `$while` output do not prepare unused
  body declarations.
- Context shadow state is intentional runtime state:
  `ScopeFrame.liveSlotsByName`, `ScopeFrame.fallbackFrame`, and
  `Context.rulesContext` remain the kept model.
- Recent scope/context cleanup is consolidated across `$while`, `AtRule`,
  `Reference`, mixin calls, and `Rules` registration/eval. Do not re-expand
  duplicated save/restore scaffolding without a focused failing test.
- Ordinary temporary `rulesContext` switches share `tree/util/context.ts`;
  manual restore callbacks remain only where a larger custom flow needs them.
- Node-copy, render-buffer, and materialization frontier scans cover production
  package `src` trees across the monorepo. The node-copy frontier is clean for
  deep copy/clone and ordinary production `.copy()` outside infrastructure.
- Generated selector/output ownership has focused guards for extend,
  `:is(...)`, pseudo args, framed ampersands, and ruleset headers. Keep owned
  placement surfaces only where parentage/visibility tests prove they are
  semantic.
- Function-call cleanup keeps plain positional JS args canonical. Metadata
  functions keep one owned raw/callback arg-list surface for documented
  runtime APIs; `Call` no longer creates a second pre-copy before
  `callWithContext(...)`.
- `@charset` output-order handling lives in `Rules` registration prep.
  `Any.prepareRegistration()` is mark-only again.
- Pending declaration-name prep is a narrow lookup-identity retry, not a hidden
  tree-wide pre-eval pass. Pending non-declaration identity prep is a
  source-ordered one-shot pass.

## Immediate Queue

This is a pop queue. Keep at least seven concrete items here. If the top item
is completed, remove it and promote or split enough backlog work to keep the
queue full. If an item is too broad to complete in one checkpoint, replace it
with the smallest honest next checkpoint and move the broader theme to the
backlog below.

1. **Render-source helper callsite audit.**
   - Goal: inspect current `renderSourceOutput(...)` call sites and find the
     next one that can become native render without adding wrapper layers.
   - Required proof: focused node tests for the chosen callsite plus
   materialization frontier.

2. **Loop output grouping wrapper audit.**
   - Goal: inspect zero/multi eval-output `Rules` grouping wrappers after the
     function-registry split and decide whether any wrapper can shrink further
     without losing output ownership.
   - Required proof: focused loop eval/render tests plus node-copy frontier.

3. **Call render native-surface audit.**
   - Goal: inspect the remaining `Call.render(...)` branches and find one
     wrapper/helper path that can shrink while preserving CSS-call vs JS-call
     semantics.
   - Required proof: focused call render tests plus materialization frontier.

4. **Define-function lint debt audit.**
   - Goal: clean the existing lint debt in `packages/core/src/define-function.ts`
     enough that future argument-surface changes can touch it without dragging
     unrelated unsafe-assertion failures into the checkpoint.
   - Required proof: focused define-function ESLint plus define-function tests.

5. **Reference render native-surface audit.**
   - Goal: inspect `Reference.render(...)` and source-output call sites for one
     helper path that can become native render without changing live-slot,
     fallback, or optional-reference semantics.
   - Required proof: focused reference render tests plus materialization
   frontier.

6. **AtRule render native-surface audit.**
   - Goal: inspect `AtRule.render(...)` and header/body source-output call
     sites for one helper path that can become native render without changing
     lifted prelude scope, hoist, or root-order semantics.
   - Required proof: focused at-rule render tests plus materialization
     frontier.

7. **Ruleset render native-surface audit.**
   - Goal: inspect `Ruleset.render(...)` and header/body source-output call
     sites for one helper path that can become native render without changing
     composed selector, reference, or hoist behavior.
   - Required proof: focused ruleset render tests plus materialization
     frontier.

## Backlog

These are remaining architecture themes, not immediate queue items. Promote
one only after turning it into a concrete checkpoint.

No backlog items are currently promoted beyond the immediate queue. Add a new
theme here only after the current queue item is completed or split.

## Verification

Use the nearest focused test while iterating. Before claiming a handoff-level
status change, run:

```sh
pnpm run verify:node-copy-frontier
pnpm run verify:render-buffer-frontier
pnpm run verify:materialization-frontier
pnpm run verify:package-exports
pnpm run verify:baseline -- --changed
```

Use the full baseline when a change touches root gates, package metadata,
shared verifier scripts, or broad render/eval contracts:

```sh
pnpm run verify:baseline
```

## Checkpoint Rule

A checkpoint is one coherent code or docs change with verification. If a seam
is too large, finish the smallest honest slice that leaves the repo and this
handoff more truthful than before.

For each checkpoint:

1. Read the relevant source and focused tests before editing.
2. Make the smallest behavior-preserving change.
3. Run focused proof first.
4. Run the nearest broader verification.
5. Update this handoff if the current state or immediate queue changed.
6. Commit and push when clean.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask before inventing semantics when:

- a fixture conflicts with documented Jess behavior;
- a wrapper seems removable but carries scope, import/reference, selector
  placement, or delayed-output state;
- a red appears only in `packages/jess/test/less/all-less.test.ts` and there is
  no focused parser/core repro yet;
- fixing a frontier requires broad new helper families instead of deleting or
  narrowing existing machinery.

## Do Not Resurrect

- checked-in task registries or unattended task loops
- stage trackers that mostly describe absent machinery
- broad "current dirty diff" notes copied from an old session
- fixture-expectation changes that are not tied to an explicit Jess behavior
  decision
