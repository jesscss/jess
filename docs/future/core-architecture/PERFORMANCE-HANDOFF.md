# Core Architecture Performance Handoff

This file is the benchmark/profile doctrine and evidence log for Jess core
architecture work.

Use `HANDOFF.md` for active integration: current mode, next pass, and the
specific benchmark leash applied to the queue. Use
`AGGRESSIVE-CUTTING-REVIEW.md` for the hardline cutting doctrine. Use this file
for benchmark protocol, measured targets, rejected experiments, historical
evidence, active performance queues, and reactivation thresholds.

Current mode: **benchmark-leashed aggressive cutting**. Performance is no
longer merely parked. The active handoff decides the next target, but the
target must be tied back to this file's benchmark/profile evidence rules.

## Preserved Lesson

Historical transition docs were removed from the working tree. The durable
lesson they preserved remains: the target is still one canonical source tree,
explicit live lookup/binding state, source-order render/eval, temporary output
state, and no routine copied evaluated AST.

## Historical Evidence To Preserve

The April 2026 broad Less benchmark audit found a real architectural
regression, not a small constant-factor problem:

- owner context at the time: before the value-forking era, Jess was roughly
  `1.6x` Less runtime on the broad benchmark path;
- April comparison: modern benchmark cases were roughly `36x` to `46x` slower
  than Less;
- `benchmark.less`: Jess `1724.7ms` avg vs Less `47.4ms` avg;
- `benchmark-v39.less`: Jess `29.1ms` avg vs Less `4.6ms` avg;
- older/smaller fixtures were competitive or faster, so the slowdown was tied
  to modern Less features and runtime architecture, not a universal parser or
  serializer tax.

Representative one-render instrumentation for broad `benchmark.less` showed:

- `Rules.find`: `301,333` calls;
- `DeclarationRegistry.find`: `260,728` calls;
- `Reference.evalNode`: `12,037` calls;
- `OutputWriter.capture`: `515,451` calls;
- `OutputWriter.getSince`: `1,064,254` calls;
- `OutputWriter.restore`: `522,538` calls;
- `OutputWriter.mark`: `1,132,616` calls;
- `Node.clone`: `92,683` calls;
- `Node.copy`: `73,607` calls.

The registry audit also found extremely hot declaration keys, especially
lexical globals and recursive mixin/loop variables:

- `base-hue`: `93,810`;
- `icon-prefix`: `28,920`;
- `i`: `28,853`;
- `base-url`: `27,580`;
- `white`: `17,444`;
- `cols`: `11,745`.

Carry this forward as the performance thesis:

- lookup must become direct frame/binding access for hot reference types;
- declaration lookup must not allocate `Set`s, convert to arrays, sort, and
  repeat generic recursive searches for ordinary variable reads;
- writer capture/rollback must not stringify or slice output just to inspect
  then throw away the result;
- copy/clone/inherit/frozen must not be routine eval/render isolation;
- extend work must be selective to touched roots/rulesets and avoid repeated
  full-tree searches, selector stringification, and cloned selector structures.

## Current Policy

Performance is active again as a leash on aggressive cutting. The next broad
eval/render/lookup/copy/rules/render-buffer change must start from a current
benchmark or profile target and end with the same benchmark/profile rerun.

In benchmark-leashed cutting mode:

- keep the aggressive-cutting posture: delete machinery and semantic reasons
  for work rather than polishing helpers;
- run focused tests and full gates before claiming behavior progress;
- run stable hot-path benchmarks before and after non-trivial hot-path edits;
- use profiler/counter/CPU-profile evidence to choose targets, not to claim
  "Jess got faster";
- do not claim speed wins without real benchmark evidence;
- reject or reshape changes that reduce local object counts but slow or fail
  to improve the real benchmark, unless the change fixes correctness and the
  regression is explicitly accepted as debt.

## Reactivation Threshold

Full performance rounds are currently active. If future work parks performance
again, bring full performance rounds back as active work when any one of these
is true:

1. A broad architecture batch touches one of the measured hot surfaces:
   reference lookup/render, callable output/body placement, rules/ruleset body
   rendering, at-rule header/body rendering, extend matching, parser/compat
   facade, `OutputWriter`, `Node` traversal, `clone/copy/inherit/frozen`, or
   `List`/`Sequence` materialization.
2. Two consecutive queue passes land without removing obvious hot-path object
   creation/function-call/generator/Array-helper waste.
3. The full alpha/correctness queue is clear and the next proposed work is a
   performance-motivated rewrite rather than a local deletion.
4. `pnpm run measure:less:hotpath` shows a median regression of roughly **10% or
   more** on any primary fixture, or a consistent smaller regression across two
   consecutive samples.
5. A CPU/V8 profile shows a concrete top-frame surface whose fix is not a small
   local cleanup.

Once reactivated, do not do unmeasured performance work. Every performance
round needs a before snapshot, one hypothesis, one patch, focused tests, the
same after snapshot, and a keep/revert decision.

## Required Real Benchmark Inputs

Record Jess alpha hot-path snapshots:

```sh
pnpm run measure:less:hotpath -- --stable
```

Treat the printed `signal=` field as the benchmark trust gate. `usable` can
support a keep/revert decision, `unstable` needs another run or CPU/allocation
profile corroboration, and `noisy` is not decision-quality evidence.

For quick smoke checks during cutting, the cheaper bounded run is still useful
as a regression tripwire:

```sh
pnpm run measure:less:hotpath -- --iterations 15 --warmup 5
```

Use saved hot-path fixture comparisons when keeping a patch:

```sh
pnpm run measure:less:hotpath:record -- --stable --note "<short hypothesis/result>"
```

The broad Less benchmark fixture can still be inspected when
`/Users/matthew/git/oss/less.js` is available:

```sh
node scripts/profile-less-benchmark.mjs --file=benchmark.less
```

## Required Profile Inputs

Build the relevant packages before profiling:

```sh
pnpm --filter @jesscss/core build
pnpm --filter @jesscss/less-parser build
pnpm --filter @jesscss/plugin-less build
pnpm --filter @jesscss/plugin-less-compat build
pnpm --filter jess build
```

Use profiler/counter runs for diagnosis, not user-facing speed claims:

```sh
node scripts/profile-less-benchmark.mjs --file=benchmark-v37.less
node scripts/profile-less-benchmark.mjs --file=benchmark-v39.less
node scripts/profile-less-benchmark.mjs --file=benchmark-color-stress.less
node scripts/profile-less-benchmark.mjs --file=benchmark.less
```

Use CPU profiles when call stacks are unclear:

```sh
./scripts/profile-test.sh core "<test-file-or-filter>"
./scripts/profile-test.sh jess "<test-file-or-filter>"
```

Use phase timing only as diagnostic support:

```sh
JESS_PROFILE=1 node scripts/profile-less-benchmark.mjs --file=benchmark-v37.less
```

## Evidence Rules

- **Real benchmark** numbers are the only numbers that count as "Jess got
  faster/slower".
- **Instrumented profiler** numbers are diagnostic counters/timings only.
- **CPU profile** sample counts identify hot stacks; they are not benchmark
  timings.
- Static node/object audits are supporting evidence only.

If a patch reduces local object counts but slows real benchmarks, reject or
reshape it.

## Current Evidence Log

### 2026-06-05 Callable Default-Guard Classification

Hypothesis: `prepareCallableEvalCandidates(...)` should not recursively inspect
candidate guards to rediscover `default()`. The parser already knows whether a
guard contains `default()` while parsing Less guard syntax, so parsed Less must
carry explicit `hasDefault: true | false`; direct API construction can infer
the flag once at construction/entry creation when the option is omitted.

Before patch:

- stable hot-path baseline on commit `9d3ea09467ca480fb18fe7d17418459e346b04fa`:
  `functions` median `13.74ms`, `import-reference` median `22.04ms`,
  `mixins-guards` median `74.84ms`;
- broad instrumented `benchmark.less`: `Reference.evalNode` `3619` calls /
  `94.12ms`, `Rules.find` `1013` calls / `30.26ms`, `OutputWriter.getSince`
  `149331` calls / `5.45ms`;
- CPU profile top frames included `guardContainsDefault` `313` samples,
  `copyChild` `148`, `Node` `43`, `copyCallableRulesValue` `25`,
  `findWithinScopeSurface` `19`, `findVarWithinScopeSurface` `15`,
  `copyWithReusableLeaves` `12`, and `inherit` `11`;
- node-creation audit stayed broad: `new-node` `321`, `with-surface` `36`,
  `copy-leaves` `31`, `derive` `30`.

Patch kept:

- `packages/less-parser/src/productions/root.ts` passes `hasDefault: true` or
  `hasDefault: false` for guarded Less mixins/rulesets;
- `packages/core/src/tree/util/callable-candidate.ts` trusts
  `candidate.options?.hasDefault === true` and no longer scans guard trees or
  rewrites candidate metadata in the candidate loop;
- `Mixin`/`Ruleset` constructors and `callableRulesEntry(...)` infer the flag
  only for direct/synthetic construction when the caller did not provide it.

After patch:

- stable hot-path benchmark: `functions` median `12.86ms`,
  `import-reference` median `19.78ms`, `mixins-guards` median `18.74ms`,
  `extend-chaining` median `5.30ms`, `media` median `6.46ms`; all five
  signals were `usable`;
- final CPU profile
  `profiling/core-architecture/CPU.20260605.174243.84124.0.001.cpuprofile`
  showed `guardContainsDefault = 0` samples and
  `callableGuardContainsDefault = 0` samples;
- final broad instrumented `benchmark.less`: `Reference.evalNode` `3619` calls
  / `92.71ms`, `Rules.find` `1013` calls / `30.31ms`,
  `OutputWriter.getSince` `149331` calls / `5.51ms`;
- final CPU top frames shifted to copy/ownership and lookup:
  `copyChild` `144`, `Node` `35`, `copyCallableRulesValue` `24`,
  `findVarWithinScopeSurface` `23`, `findWithinScopeSurface` `14`,
  `copyWithReusableLeaves` `11`, `constructCopy` `10`, `inherit` `9`.

Next measured target:

- Copy/ownership is now the hottest concrete stack, not guard detection.
  `copyChild` samples group under `copyValueForDerived` (`45`),
  `getHeaderString` (`42`), `callWithContext` (`28`), `ownSelector` (`28`),
  `createRegistrationState` (`22`), `evaluateReferenceValueNode` (`20`), and
  `cloneBoundValue` (`9`). Treat this as evidence of registration derivation,
  selector header rendering, JS function argument ownership, reference value
  eval, and binding clone debt, not as evidence that final CSS rendering needs
  child copying.
- Repeated callable/mixin eval is suspicious. Before more helper polish, count
  semantic mixin calls versus candidate/output evals and decide whether live
  placement/binding state can avoid repeated body evaluation or copied public
  materialization.

## Parked Measured Targets

Keep these targets visible when performance rounds reactivate:

- Copy recursion: `copyChild`, `constructCopy`, `copyWithReusableLeaves`,
  `copyCallableRulesValue`, callable output/body placement.
- Node construction and copied ownership: `Node` construction, `.clone()`,
  `.copy()`, `.inherit()`, `frozen`.
- Variable/reference lookup: `findVarWithinScopeSurface`,
  `findWithinScopeSurface`, `Reference.render`, `Reference.evalNode`,
  `finalizeReferenceLookupResult`.
- Render serialization: `serializeRulesContainerInternal`, `renderRulesBody`,
  `_emitRulesBody`, `emitNode`, `getHeaderString`, `OutputWriter.getSince`.
- Extend matching: `wouldMatchNode`, `processExtends`,
  `applyExtendsToSelector`, `isSameOrDescendantRoot`.
- Generic traversal/materialization: `Node.forEachNode`, `Node.children`,
  `Node.nodes`, `List.resolveItems`, `Sequence.evaluateValues`,
  generator/Array-helper/tuple-array traversal.
- Parser/compat facade overhead when benchmark profiles point above core.

## Future Research Lanes

These are not active cut-queue items. Start one only after the reactivation
threshold trips, or when a focused profile says the named surface is the next
real bottleneck.

### Null-Proto Lookup Slots

Experiment: compare hot variable-reference lookup using null-prototype string
slot tables against the current lookup containers.

Hypothesis:

- `Object.create(null)` may be faster and lighter than `Map` for hot string-key
  variable names;
- lookup should return a stable `BindingCell`, not a raw node, so live-binding
  semantics are independent of the dictionary implementation;
- explicit `parentFrame` walking should be tested before prototype-chain scope
  inheritance because it is easier to reason about for shadowing, assignment,
  import/reference visibility, mixin invocation, and Sass-style live updates.

Candidate shape:

```ts
interface ScopeFrame {
  slots: Record<string, BindingCell | undefined>;
  parent: ScopeFrame | undefined;
}

interface BindingCell {
  value: Node;
  flags: number;
  sourceDecl: Node | undefined;
  version: number;
}
```

Test variants:

1. `Map<string, BindingCell>` lookup.
2. `Object.create(null)` slots plus explicit `parentFrame` walk.
3. `Object.create(parentSlots)` prototype-chain reads, only after variant 2 is
   correct and measured.
4. Optional split dictionaries for lexical/scope keys and linear/live-binding
   keys if Sass-style semantics require different write/read behavior.

Required proof before keeping any patch:

- focused Less variable lookup tests: lexical shadowing, recursive mixin/loop
  variables, defaults, imports/reference imports, declaration order, and live
  assignment/update behavior;
- focused Sass-style live-binding tests if the runtime path claims to preserve
  those semantics;
- same real benchmark before/after snapshot;
- no broad registry rewrite unless the small hot variable-reference path wins.

### JavaScript Backend / Native Scope Execution

Historical idea: original Jess advertised itself as JavaScript-evaluated style
sheets and compiled `.jess` stylesheets to JavaScript. That direction may have
been fast because lexical variables, closures, and ordinary function calls let
the JavaScript engine handle much of the scope and execution machinery.

Treat this as a radical research backend, not the active Less eval/render
architecture.

Main-branch evidence:

- `packages/jess/README.md` says Jess "transpiles to JavaScript
  under-the-hood."
- `packages/jess/src/render-module.ts` parses `.jess`, then calls
  `root.toModule(...)` twice to produce compile-time and runtime JS modules.
- `packages/jess/src/render.ts` runs Rollup, writes the generated compiler JS,
  `require(...)`s it, and calls its default export to produce CSS.
- `Root.toModule(...)` emits a JS default function, builds `$TREE` with
  `$J.root((() => { const $OUT = []; ... })())`, then calls
  `$J.renderCss($TREE, $CONTEXT)`.
- `Mixin.toModule(...)` emits JS functions for simple mixins, and `Let` emits
  JS bindings / override plumbing for `@let`.
- `Call.toModule(...)` emits a lazy `ref: () => name` for JS-callable names and
  falls back to CSS calls when the reference is not available.

Important distinction: the main-branch backend was a hybrid. It used JS
lexical names and function calls, but it still generated Jess node objects and
then evaluated/rendered a `$TREE`. The future experiment should measure both
the historical hybrid and a more radical direct-emission backend that writes CSS
without building an evaluated AST.

Hypothesis:

- for Jess-native syntax, compiling to JavaScript may make simple variables,
  functions, loops, and imports much cheaper than interpreting an AST;
- native JS scope and closure capture may replace a large share of registry,
  lookup, and frame plumbing;
- generated JS can let V8 optimize stable hot paths better than a generic
  node-dispatch interpreter.

Primary risk:

- Less mixin semantics do not map cleanly to plain JavaScript functions. Less
  mixins can be overloaded, guarded, merged, namespaced, used as maps, unlocked
  into caller scope in deprecated paths, participate in reference/import
  visibility, interact with `default()`, and depend on declaration/order
  behavior that is not just lexical JS scope.

Research shape:

1. Start with Jess-native or strict-Less subset only: variables, declarations,
   simple nesting, simple functions, loops, and plain mixins.
2. Generate JS that writes CSS directly to a buffer. Do not generate a second
   evaluated AST.
3. Represent mixin overload sets explicitly rather than pretending every Less
   mixin is one JS function.
4. Treat guards/default resolution, detached rulesets, mixin maps, reference
   imports, extends, and deprecated caller-scope leakage as separate semantic
   modules that may stay interpreted or call into runtime helpers.
5. Compare generated-JS backend against current render/eval on tiny fixtures,
   recursive mixin stress, broad Less hot-path fixtures, and Jess-native
   examples.

Keep criteria:

- generated JS must preserve source diagnostics and sourcemap strategy;
- the backend must be opt-in or isolated until it proves Less compatibility;
- no active runtime refactor should depend on this experiment succeeding;
- if it wins, use the result to inform the interpreter shape: direct emission,
  lexical binding cells, static templates, and fewer generic node dispatches.

## Parked Lessons

- Declaration pre-render caching regressed enough real benchmarks that it should
  not be retried broadly without a tighter profile target.
- Virtual callable-output wrappers passed focused tests but slowed real
  hot-path samples; do not replace owned children with wrapper objects on the
  hot path.
- Local copy-loop polishing is not a destination. Delete the reason for the
  copy or move ownership behind a cold materialization boundary.
- `profile-less-benchmark.mjs` elapsed time is profiler overhead. Do not report
  it as a user-facing speed result unless debugging the profiler itself.
