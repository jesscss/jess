# Core Architecture Handoff

This is the stable router for Jess core architecture work. Keep it short: it
tells the next agent where to choose a focus, how to complete a pass, and where
progress is tracked. Do not rewrite this file just to switch focus; set the
chat/Guildhall goal from `FOCII.md` instead.

## Focus Router

Choose exactly one active focus before editing. If the user names a focus,
follow that. If the request is ambiguous, infer from the branch and latest user
instruction, then record the chosen focus in the final response instead of
changing this router. Use `FOCII.md` for the goal prompt, boundaries, stop rule,
and required docs.

- **Binding / lookup:** use `BINDING-LOOKUP-REMAINING.md` for the active queue,
  remaining scope, progress notes, and completion gates. Use
  `BINDING-INDEX-PROPOSAL.md` for design intent. This stream owns registryless
  lookup, direct crawl/frame lookup, reference handles, live/current binding,
  fallback bridge deletion, and lookup profiles.
- **Serialization / `writeSyntax`:** use `NODE-REWRITE-TRACKER.md` for the
  active node-family queue, historical row status, serialization contracts, and
  completion gates. This stream owns direct syntax/render emission, cold public
  string wrappers, render readback removal, and node-family row closure.
- **Performance evidence:** use `PERFORMANCE-HANDOFF.md` for benchmark
  protocol, profile history, rejected experiments, and speed claims.
- **Patch-shape review:** use `AGGRESSIVE-CUTTING-REVIEW.md` before changing
  AST, eval/render, lookup, traversal, copying, inheritance, output writer,
  source/root metadata, or this router.

## Shared Direction

The fastest credible runtime path remains:

- one canonical source tree;
- direct eval/render-to-string for normal output;
- live lookup/binding/placement state instead of routine copied eval trees;
- cold materialization only for public APIs or real semantic ownership
  boundaries;
- fewer hot-path objects, arrays, recursive walks, helper calls, branch ladders,
  promise/generator states, and metadata mutations.

Less is the optimizing path. Preserve SCSS-enabling seams only when they are
concrete and cheap or isolated behind cold extension boundaries.

Do not preserve an unreleased or self-invented public-looking method for
compatibility alone. If repo usage does not need it and the user has not
approved it as API, delete or reshape it.

## Completion Rules

When the user says `continue`, `do all queue items`, `complete the queue`, or
`full queue pass`, run an autonomous focus pass:

1. Snapshot `git status --short --branch`.
2. Read this router, `FOCII.md`, and the chosen focus tracker.
3. State one hypothesis before editing.
4. Work through the active queue as a swath, not one micro-edit.
5. Keep moving until the queue is drained, the next item has materially
   different semantics, the next step needs user/product judgment, evidence
   rejects the approach, or a failing test/debugging thread needs focused
   investigation.
6. Use focused tests while iterating; run full gates at the coherent batch
   boundary.
7. Update the chosen focus tracker with only facts that change the next
   worker's decisions.
8. Update `Aggressive Cutting Self-Prosecution` below for the latest pass.
9. Commit and push the batch with `--no-verify` when the pass is complete.

A queue item must be a whole task with its own proof surface. It may contain
several sub-tasks, helper deletions, rejected cuts, and tests. Do not create or
mark complete one-line queue items. If an active queue item remains unfinished
at wrap-up, record in the focus tracker and final response which item remains,
what blocked immediate continuation, and why stopping was necessary.

Each active focus tracker should keep at least 15 unchecked sizable tasks
available unless that focus is genuinely within 15 tasks of completion.
Reseeding the next queue is closeout work, not a queue item. Completed history
belongs in git, focused tracker rows, or `PERFORMANCE-HANDOFF.md`, not in this
router.

Use sub-agents when available for disjoint evidence or implementation slices.
Good assignments include one node-family row, one lookup family, focused test
surface discovery, profile/call-stack audits, or review against the aggressive
cutting rules. Workers must not make overlapping edits, revert unrelated work,
commit independently, or change the selected focus. The main agent owns
integration, verification, docs, commit, push, and continuation.

## Gate Rules

Always run the smallest relevant test first. Before commit, run:

```sh
git diff --check
pnpm run verify:aggressive-cutting-review
```

Then run the chosen focus gates from its tracker. Use
`PERFORMANCE-HANDOFF.md` before making any speed claim. Use
`pnpm run verify:baseline -- --changed` when the touched area needs a broader
fixture gate. The current hook path has previously looped, so commit and push
with `--no-verify` after the explicit gates pass.

## Aggressive Cutting Self-Prosecution

- Latest pass: declaration-constraint option cleanup and merge-chain
  output-binding proof.
- Verdict: accepted as a binding/API-shape and handle-proof cut. The direct
  declaration lookup option surface no longer accepts scalar exclusion fields,
  and `ReferenceOptions` now uses semantic `excludedDeclarations` /
  `requiredDeclarationAssignments` names instead of the old
  `excludedNodes` / `requiredNormalizedFromAssign` reference-option names.
  Production merge assignment carries source/output exclusions as one mutable
  semantic list. No speed claim.
- New traversal: no new production traversal. Direct declaration filtering
  still checks the existing exclusion list with `includes(...)`; this pass
  deletes the separate scalar option checks from direct lookup. The new loops
  are verifier-only forbidden-token scans in
  `verify:binding-lookup-hot-paths`, not runtime lookup work.
- New node/materialization: no nodes, wrappers, copied rules, inherited
  metadata, or runtime materialized arrays were added. Merge assignment already
  needed an exclusion carrier; it is now one array allocated with the reference
  and mutated at `bindOutput`, replacing hidden scalar getter fields. Focused
  tests allocate semantic exclusion arrays and an options object to exercise
  the public shape; those are test-only proof scaffolding.
- Render path: declaration merge rendering still resolves through the existing
  reference lookup path and writes the same output; no render-to-string readback
  or public materialization path was added.
- Helper/API surface: removed `ReferenceDeclarationConstraintOptions` and
  `getReferenceDeclarationConstraintOptions(...)`. No new runtime helper was
  added. `verify:binding-lookup-hot-paths` gained guard checks for the deleted
  direct/public option fields.
- Metadata mutations: none.
- Allocation changes: the merge-assignment reference now keeps one semantic
  exclusion array instead of scalar getter properties. Private reference handle
  snapshots still store the first two excluded declaration identities and count
  for freshness comparison; slimming or proving those internals is queued in
  `BINDING-LOOKUP-REMAINING.md`.
- Evidence: focused reference tests prove mutable assignment constraints,
  mutable source/output declaration exclusions, output-binding handle
  invalidation, wider exclusion lists staying cold, and the real Less
  merge-chain fixture avoiding public property/declaration lookup bridges.
  Focused declaration merge/assignment tests and
  `verify:binding-lookup-hot-paths` passed. The full reference file still has
  pre-existing complex-selector callable failures outside this declaration
  constraint slice, so it is not used as this pass's completion gate.
- Merge-carried binding review: latest `origin/dev` also carries binding/lookup
  queue cleanup plus two rejected namespace-prefix shortcut audits. It is
  lookup-only: no render/stringification path changed, no runtime node
  materialization was added, and detailed status remains in
  `BINDING-LOOKUP-REMAINING.md`.
- Merge-carried binding review: latest `origin/dev` also carries direct
  declaration per-key cache invalidation in `packages/core/src/tree/rules.ts`
  with focused reference tests. It is lookup/cache-only: no
  render/stringification path changed. Review-flagged loop/map findings are
  the accepted bounded cache-key invalidation walk plus test-only cache-key
  snapshots/maps used to prove unrelated direct declaration entries survive.
  Detailed status remains in `BINDING-LOOKUP-REMAINING.md`.
- Merge-carried binding review: latest `origin/dev` also carries
  declaration/import key-version proof and dynamic promotion invalidation in
  `packages/core/src/tree/reference.ts`. It is binding/cache-state only:
  dynamic declarations queued on a scope frame that resolve to static names now
  bump the resolved key's declaration lookup version and invalidate only that
  key's direct declaration bucket/cache entries; no render/stringification path
  changed. Review-flagged loops/maps/arrays are the existing per-key cache
  invalidation walk and focused cache-key snapshots. Detailed status remains in
  `BINDING-LOOKUP-REMAINING.md`.
- Merge note: latest `origin/dev` also carries serialization work for
  `Operation`, `QueryCondition`, and scalar token-family at-rule header/leaf
  syntax readback cuts, plus Ruleset/Ampersand serialization cuts from the
  latest merge and the child `Rules` wrapper preview-transport cut; keep that
  progress in `NODE-REWRITE-TRACKER.md` while this worktree continues
  binding/lookup. Review-flagged `CountingWriter`
  constructions, detached `OutputWriter` header string boundaries, custom
  syntax subclass constructions, scalar `any(...)` fixtures, explicit
  `new Anonymous('html')`, and empty-arg `call(...)` test fixtures are
  serialization proof scaffolding from merges; they are not new binding runtime
  machinery.
- Merge-carried serialization review: latest `origin/dev` also carries `For`
  source writer work in `control.ts`, including the existing pattern/range
  child loop plus focused `If`/`For`/`While` construction fixtures and
  `WholeBufferCountingWriter` assertions. Those review-flagged loops, arrays,
  node constructions, and thrown test errors belong to the serialization
  tracker and are not new binding lookup runtime machinery.
